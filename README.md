- [ ] TASK 8: implement EEFM present worth, future worth, emi, interest schemes - give option for company to pay lesser amount now, or eventually pay larger amount over period of time - stuff like that - varied partial payments (NOTE: NET30 and pay earlier than 30 are the most sensible ones to implement for MSMEs, that too in india. look into these options though)  
- [ ] TASK 27: new flow for vendor's side. no longer are there two parts (product management and vendor requests). there is just product management (renamed to products) - where every product will have another "expandable" which upon expanding, expands into the list of companies that had requested for it, the current status of that request
- [ ] TASK 56: and then add more fields in product/user table/schema (like reviews and stars)
- [ ] TASK 122: vendor side could also show the star rating for each of the product requests
