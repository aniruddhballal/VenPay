Tasks – completed, yet to be completed (priorities), discarded ideas, currently implementing, lessons/ideas learnt
- 1. sort and filter the accepted product requests
- 2. sort and filter the type of requests (based on products)
- 3. overall UI
- 4. payment gateway integration
- 5. soonest payment first
- 6. warning for deadline nearings
- 7. overdue payments
- 8. implement EEFM present worth, future worth, emi, interest schemes - give option for company to pay lesser amount now, or eventually pay larger amount over period of time - stuff like that - varied partial payments (NOTE: NET30 and pay earlier than 30 are the most sensible ones to implement for MSMEs, that too in india. look into these options though)
- 9. giving discounts and star ratings/credits for companies/vendors for keeping integrity.
- 10. switch to mongodb atlas? check if i should be having all the database stuff in compass ka localhost 120710 something or if it is better to have it connected to that VendorManagement thing that i created (maybe create a new one)
- 11. i think, we can have individual payment requests ke liye ek ek button and then at the bottom of the page, we can have "all displayed payment requests" ko clear karne ke liye ek button and we can use filters and sort and stuff to change whats displayed on the page - so we can kinda group the payments and pay in bulk.
- 12. alright now, can you add a  button next to each of the accepted products, which says "make payment" along with an input text box. this text box should accept any amount thats equal to or lesser than the total price of the quantity of the same product bought. and on clicking on "make payment" it should ask the company to re-enter the password. if it is same, then it should make the transaction and keep track of how much is paid and how much needs to be paid next, and change the status from unpaid to partially paid and if at all the entire amount is paid then change it to paid.
- 13. IMPROVE THE UI UX ADD A LOT OF USER HELPFUL INTERACTIVE STUFF
- 14. features like sort, and search/filter by vendor/company
- 15. autoscroll to high priority payments, set priorities to payments (defaulting to the deadlines), but editable
- 16. make sure any feature implemented on company side, also gets implemented on vendor side

- 17. check different ways for displaying the products, requests - catalogue? idk some scrolling animation - edit: carousel not - catalogue lmao
- 18. check if background can be made better - colour grading and scheming
- 19. filter/search options
- 20. company and vendor - total profits/total due/total income/total paid
- 21. credit rating scores for companies and vendors
- 22. add images for the products - add more details for each product
- 23. add reviews for products and vendors and companies - should be able to visit a particular vendor's/company's "profile"
- 24. so i think it boils down to - adding more fields in the product schema - and enabling the viewing of vendor/company profiles – separate viewing of each product’s image(s) and rating/ reviews
- 25. so yes, images have been added (vendor side only, yet to implement company side). now comes creating new pages for viewing products, companies, vendors - individually.
- 26. can add more metadata about all the products - 
- 27. new flow for vendor's side. no longer are there two parts (product management and vendor requests). there is just product management (renamed to products) - where every product will have another "expandable" which upon expanding, expands into the list of companies that had requested for it, the current status of that request
- 28. check screenshot, there is an issue in showing the flipped side of the product card, the image shows up too, like a glitch in the matrix
- 29. the glitch is resolved, product cards are way smoother and better now
- 30. let's focus on other things - like the product card alternatives - look into where those stylish designs can be applied and the idea of each company/vendor/product having their own pages - all linked to each other - then after that comes star rating and reviews
- 31. remove redundacy from ProductManagement.module.css - and then merge with index4.css
- 32. this is done, i am now working on getting the ProductList.tsx to match the ProductManagement.tsx - regarding the display of the products in the grid - the hover card idea
- 33. note to self: add a buffer/loading thing whilst the new image/new product is being added to database.
- 34. upload ProductManagement, ProductList - new components and index5 onto git - done.
- 35. we shall add the loading/buffer thingy now.
- 36. after this should be getting each product their own page. every vendor. every company - when they visit own profile - edit option.
- 37. note to self: it is sometimes better to roll back into a previous version of your code, with lesser number of ideas having found implementation. But you know it’s a version that works. While developing, it is so crucial to have older versions of your code, and knowing when it is too late/too deep in a debug issue that started “after” you modified a safe version of your code and to roll back into this safer version and start over again. start afresh. Maybe re view your ideas that you wanted to implement, maybe its not that deep, maybe implement the same idea in a different way. But re start.
- 38. check if company side hover cards look okay? or maybe the grid size or the size of each hover card - hmmm
- 39. also, in the "uploading and creating..." - make that also change into "uploading and updating" or "uploading and creating" based on whether the new image is for updation or for creation.

- 41. https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo209942751.html
- 42. done with buffer, going to create separate pages for products and vendor/company profiles i guess.
- 43. its hard to decide if i have to create the separate products page first or the user details first create a universal users page, where only people who have logged in can see the other persons profile. sth like Instagram and then when you view your own profile, you'll have the edit profile option. maybe i should create the individual products' page first but where do the users click on to land there? should i end up modifying the current product expand/hover card style?
- 44. created the productdisplay page hoorayyy, it works - i gotta style it and stuff - later on. now, user display page??
- 45. niceeeee, vendor page display is done on companyside - next is company page display on vendorside
- 46. gotta modify so many codes on git tom morning - SO MCUH TO STYLE TOO - and make the products/users table contain more details.
- 47. UP NEXT: reviews, star ratingssss. WOWWW company page display from vendors is done toooo! now only:
- 48. styling of UserDisplay.tsx ProductDisplay.tsx
- 49. make sure only logged in users can see other's profiles
- 50. edit profile option
- 51. add more fields in product and user schemas
- 52. reviews/star ratings
- 53. add that akon song that lucassfit used + that new thing/profile on consumerism
- 54. done with point 49. logged users (used authMiddleware.ts to implement protected routes)
- 55. now, profile edit option if its the same user
- 56. and then add more fields in product/user table/schema (like reviews and stars)
- 57. and then style the frontend
- 58. edit profile takes you to a diff page yes but now, i need a editprofile page - right?
- 59. YAYYY done with new profile page, new editprofile page - for all users. it shows any profile only if the person is logged into their account - and editprofile shows up only while displaying that user's details who is logged in currently
- 60. added a "go to dashboard" button to go back from the userdisplay page to the dashboard page. 
- 61. "save changes" on editprofile will take user right back to userdisplay page.
- 62. NOW whats left is productdisplay page and then ratings for products, and then eventually companies and vendors.
- 63. so, done with point 3. Edit profile option
- 64. although all these changes have no ui-ux css styling right now, have to work on that. will do that before creating products page now.
- 65. gotta add more fields in user schema too.
- 66. INLINE PRODUCT CARD - EDIT DETAILS IS CRAZYYYY - IMPLEMENT IT FOR PRODUCT IMAGE ALSO, then you can remove the whole top part of the vendor dashboard - Create product can be the last productcard out of all the rest. last mai empty template for product creation.
- 67. done implementing for product image. i need to make the last part of the product cards gridlist into the create product option 
- 68. yes, done with implementing the create product as the last product hover card in the gridlist. yayyy
css styles to make better:
- 69. the onclick field edit option - THIS REMAINS
- 70. user profile and product styles - for editing and viewing both - THIS DONE
new idea to implement + css styles:
- 71. product page - reviews and star rating - YET TO ADD NEW FIELDS into schema - DONE
- 72. sort index.css out and merge the three module.css files - UHH LATER

left with styling of:
- 74. onfield click edit option
- 75. manual deadline - DONE
- 76. vendor link in company dashboard
- 77. index.css + 3 module.css files - note to self, the css files are getting too messy, i think module files are the way to go - that would reduce complexity but the number of css files would growwww;
- 78. modules done for the simpler, single use classnames - productrequests, paymentrequests, productmanagement, productlist - these are all put in one big remaining.css for further sorting on some other day i guess 
- 79. there is an issue with who can see the product details - the reviews, comments - make it all public for logged in users. - DONE
- 80. modified multiple react_css into react_mui
- 81. learnt about react+mui dependency issues
up next:
- 82. onfield click edit option - not done yet
- 83. vendor link in company dashboard - not done yet
- 84. also, gotta make some real app like tariq said - not some to do - also learn more on reducer, react, redux, states, refreshing, mgmt all that
- 85. okay, the product display page looks too bad right now. ask it to maintain the theme, interactiveness, and colour and styling of the userdisplay and editprofile tsx files.
- 86. gotta MUI-fy the dashboard page too
- 87. HMM, or MUI-fy the sub contents of the dashboard page, let'see - the dark theme is getting to me. lighter is kinda better
- 88. gotta match the details/delete button for all the products with the green, purple thingy.
- 89. add go back to dashboard button after visiting the product page
umm here's a small summary of all the updates on the productmanagement page:
- 90. inline editing UI is just too good now (except for image editing - will get back to this) - GOT BACK TO THIS FINALLY DONE.
- 91. double expandable hover cards are now multi-level expandable (depends on what fields of the product details you are editing)
- 92. auto-saving of product details when mouse leaves/stops hovering over the product card
- 93. MUI-fied CSS obviously
- 94. a lot of other small bugs, debugs wtv

- 96. NOTE TO SELF: read this readme file - find out what are the old/new to-do's - make a new list under this and start working one by one.
note ps:
- 97. a lot of dev happened on vendor side, nothing much on company side - FUNNILY, the gap in the prod-desc box still does exist? lol
- DONEEE! 98. issues with the calendar (on non-net30 payments)
- 99. add new product card - edit features - expansion level bug + lack of features that updateproductcard has

- 125. again, these are all on vendor side - so, company side??
- 126. what happens if deadline passes by?!
- 127. add a view password option while login/signup, reenter password while signing up, edit password in the edit profile page (enter twice) - PARTLY DONE - editprofile page, not on the login-signup form.
- DONE I GUESS 128. WARNING TO SELF: time mismatch of the duration before the deadline at which the payment was cleared - difference in vendor, company side
- TAKEN CARE OF! 129. rating button and review styles are very simple and are not user interactive - even for the vendor side (when he/she gives) and in general while viewing product details
- 130. filter products available by company, or when visiting vendor profile - show list of products
- KHATAM! 131. profile photo for all users.
- 132. consider cropping in 1:1 ratio not the landscape 2:3 - on main pages and the product page - should do. a crop feature while uploading, that shows them how itll be cropped and shown in square/circle
- DONE! 133. reconsider the "back to dashboard" -> "back to profile" -> edit profile - change the routing !!
- 134. REUSE COMPONENTS!!!!!! - STYLED BUTTONS, BOXES ETC - EZ PZ UNIFORMITY
- 135. user profile picture + eye icon->open image in new tab->DONT EXPOSE CLOUDINARY LINK + resize the images in hover product cards WILL DO.

- 137. component breaking down + reusability + better mui + module.css + unify the colour theming throughout the app
- HMMM OKAY, IT LOOKS FINE NOW 138. the dashboard onload curves - dont randomise maybe?
- THIS IS DONE FINALLY 139. remove compile errors from connectinglines.tsx
- SMASHED! CRAZY WORK 140. profile photo
- 141. multiple image products
- YAYY DONE HAHAHA OLD ONLY 142. password change option
- SORTED SIR! 143. infinite loop routing issue (dahsboard->profile->editprofile)
- 144. notifications
- 145. home page button
- 146. dont disclose cloudinary link
- 147. image on display -> cropped/resized?
- 148. filter products by vendors - like reviews can be filtered by companies
- YAYY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED 149. better the review giving UI
- THISSSS, DONE. 150. appearance of product/payment requests - annoying-slide-aall-the-way-to-the-bottom
- 151. payment? crypto? blockchain?
- 152. delayed payments -> charges/fees/penalties -> deadline extension option when deadline nears (change from 24h to 48h)
- 153. same product -> lend-borrow/buy-sell -> not just buy-sell
- 154. addproductcard ui from updateproductcard's
- 155. clear blank/whitespaces -> add designs -> compactify
- 156. chatbox option -> very similar to notifications
- 157. complexify the user/product tables
- 158. minimumprice limit in input/edit field of price
- 159. make reviews as a drop down or something - let it optionally occupy space
- 160. instead of having separate edit profile page - allow editing inline - just like product mgmt
- 161. implementing profile photo patch now: wait, let me think about where all this change will ripple into...
- 162. dashboard (profile button can be replaced with profile photo, same functionality onclick).
- 163. then displayuser and edit profile pages. and while showing product requests, payment requests.
- 164. BTW NONE of the payment requests - company side - show images of all the products.
- 165. the pfp is optional - so the display should be the default empty profile image or whatever they pick (dont have to ask while signup)
- 166. another idea as im implementing the pfp feature - a page to scroll thru all vendors and all companies - and then view their products.
- 167. right now, its a products page - but we can have vendors page too. vendors page with filtering products vs products page with filtering vendors. filtering prices. filtering avg star ratings.
- 168. delete old images - from cloudinary - after image updation.
- DONE DONE 169. add styles to editprofile page
- DONE YAYYYY 170. want dashboard to load with new username and deets after "save changes" from editprofile.
- 171. user display and editprofile must match styles, shape, structure - and editprofile's pfp+pw patch stands out (colours, effects)
- DONE DONEEEE 172. infinite loop - stacking pages - navigate -1
- DONE YAYYY FINALLY 173. cant access the editprofile of another user directly, but if you copy paste url, it isnt protected. it lets any logged in user edit it.
- 174. add product card vs edit product card
- 175. break productmanagement into MORE COMPONENTS MAN its 1700 lines or something
- DONE RE 176. CONNECTINGLINES.TSX - MAKE IT ERROR FREE - DONE DONE.
- DONE RESPLITTING TOO 177. combine paymentRequestsStyles-fromremainingcss.css along with PaymentRequests.tsx - and then resplit the styles. - understand what the buttonprops issue actually is. - COMBINATION DONE, RE-SPLITTING IS LEFT NOW.
- 178. convert paymentRequestsStyles.ts into the other type of exporting? why is that not working?? 
- 179. animate the underline of accepted requests/declined/pending - STARTED DOING THIS, A LOT OF SCOPE FOR ANIMATED IMPROV
- DONE 180. first make the way all the requests come - side by side not one below the other - then do this.
- 181. add loading screens instead of directly rendering some components by default
- 182. add skeletons instead of loading screens
- DONE 183. stylise the tab interface for paymentrequests and implement the same for productrequests
- 184. tab interface the two parts of the dashboard too i guess.
- 185. prompt user to add pfp if does nto exist
- 186. make the underlines of the titles come auto animated after clicking on those tabs
- DONE YAYY CHEERS SIMPLE 187. if requests of a particular type are empty - display a message saying that
- 188. black button tab interface looks ugly highkey - modify it later.
- 189. images of requested products not shown on company side - can compactify whole individual request card
- DONE 190. unify the tab styling for payment and product requests pages - same import same styles.ts
- 191. sort the requests by earliest deadline first, or by companies/vendors - give user the option of filtering.
- 192. please work on 189 - compactification, rearrangement, expansion, etc now - PLEASE DO THIS
- DONE, SORTED. 193. small task: the order of appearance - accepted, pending, declined - is not the same for vendor - user - check if there should be different preferred orders for each or unify both?
- 194. create a new type of readme.md file - sort the priorities of the tasks, list the tasks currently being worked on, the tasks completed, and the ones that are pending need to have priorities. 
- 195. an option to view the paid/cleared payment requests separately - tab interface again? inside of the accepted? OH OR MAYBE FILTER YES YES FILTER.
