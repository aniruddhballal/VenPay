# VenPay2.0
Heavily ramped up the 'VenPay' Project

# Currently, the UI-UX is VERY BAD - was working on developing the required functionalities.
Will update the frontend interface soon

update: spent 4 days on the UI-UX - its decent now, interactive, convenient and smooth. i'll just update the files here now, but now i have a longer list of improv ideas for this project lol.

#Refer to the list of "improvements to do.txt" for diary like entries - so you can understand where this app plans to reach
